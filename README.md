# Cheat Sheep : Phishing detection extension for Chromium-based browsers using Deep Learning

## Introduction

Cheat Sheep is a browser extension that detects phishing websites using deep learning. We made this extension for the Bell Geekfest Montreal 2023 hackathon. The extension is available for Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, etc. 

We are using a custom deep learning model that we trained on a dataset of phishing websites. The model analyses the HTML of the current page and gives a prediction of whether the page is a phishing website or not. The model is trained on a dataset of phishing and legitimate data. The model has an accuracy of 98.5% on the test set.
